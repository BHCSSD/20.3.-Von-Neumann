# 20.3.-Von-Neumann

In this assignment, you will look into how a Central Processing Unit (CPU) works. The main function of this is to introduce you to how the CPU gets information in, decodes it, and then runs that information. When you are done your goal is to know that the CPU is more than a little square chip that lives on the motherboard.

## Part 1 Naming, defining, and drawing part of the CPU
- You can use this link to find the basic information for Part 1 and some of Part 2 of this project.
  -   https://youtu.be/C0Pch0zpsT4?si=6de9eOCT7pOJHNPE   Use the image form 2:13 in this video for your drawing 
 
These are basic components of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), please draw out the CPU and provide clear and concise definitions for each
  - The Register
    - Program counter
    - Memory address register,  (MAR)
    - Memory Data Register (MDR)
    - Aculimator
  - control unit, (CU)
  - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU),
  - Cache
  - Clock
  - Random access memory (RAM) 

## Part 2 Fetch Decode and Execute

Along with information from the video in Part 1, please use this video, (AQA Aâ€™Level Opcodes and operands)[https://youtu.be/2h3hQCV3YcE?si=CkKTyRHo3MgyGpAj]  or this video (CAMBRIDGE IGCSE (0478-0984) 3.1 Fetch-decode-execute cycle)[  https://youtu.be/8Qx6Dr_aKXs?si=TngWJuJdOPhJI5mk]  to add on more information for the Fetch, Decode, and Execute Cycles
You will also use these video for Part 3 later on. 

Explain and show how information moves through the CPU to do basic math calculations.
Develop a creative and interactive way to show how the CPU works using the fetch, decode, and execute cycles 
Show the flow of data through the compute



## Starter code
### Be lazy, turn the blocks / if statements into functions !!! 
```

  let descriptX = 100 // sets x for where the definition shows up
  let descriptY = 10 // sets y for where the definition shows up


function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800);

  // rectMode(CENTER)// probably best not to use this for 
  textAlign(CENTER)
}

function draw() {

  background(255);

  // block 1 copy this code, edit the numbers to make other blocks
  //If you are lazy or crazy smart you would make this into a function, so you do not need to copy and paste/ edit multiple numbers
  rect(50, 50, 100, 100); //input box
  
  if (mouseX < 150 && mouseX > 50 && mouseY < 150 && mouseY > 50 ) {
    text("input device", mouseX, mouseY) //name of the block
    text("information provided by user", descriptX, descriptY) // definition of 
  }//end if

// start your next block here. 


  
  }// end draw 


// if you click this it will tell you where your mouse is
function mousePressed(){
  print(`X:${mouseX}`) 
  print(`X:${mouseX}`)
}
```
