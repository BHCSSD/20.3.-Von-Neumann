# 20.3.-Von-Neumann

In this assignment, you will look into how a Central Processing Unit (CPU) works. The main function of this is to introduce you to how the CPU gets information in, decodes it, and then runs that information. When you are done your goal is to know that the CPU is more than a little square chip that lives on the motherboard.
